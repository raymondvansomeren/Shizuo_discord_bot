# How to start using this bot

## Prerequisites

* Nodejs (version 12.18.3 or higher) and npm installed

## What to do

* Change the filename of `config.json.example` to `config.json`
* Inside that file; change `your-token-here` to your bot-token. Should look like: `"token": "NzYxMjYyMjEwMjA2NTMxNjQ1.X3YCrg.RS-iF3P2-qTPYD6O31_hm1klSao"`
* Change `your-discord-id-here` to your own discord id, get it by enabling developer mode on discord, right-click your name in any server, and copy id. When you pasted it into the `config.json` file, it should look like: `"ownerid": "270871921137000000"`
* Change `youtube-api-key-here` to your youtube api key. Should look something like: `"youtubeKey": "AIxxSxCxTxFxxx4M7xxOE80Q3OGxxxx8ADJB-FA"`
* Rest in the config file should speak for itself.
* Now run `node .` in the root directory and invite the bot to your server. Follow the instruction from [this link](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html#inviting-your-bot) to get your invite link.
